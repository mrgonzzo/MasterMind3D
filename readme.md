## Introduction

**MasterMind3D** is a 3D puzzle game that brings the logic and deduction challenges of the classic Mastermind board game into a digital, interactive format.  
Players attempt to deduce a hidden color sequence by placing colored pegs and receiving feedback on their guesses, all within a fully navigable 3D space.

This project explores:

- Game logic implementation in C# using Unity
- 3D user interface and interaction
- Visual feedback and game state management

---

## Key Features

- **3D Gameplay:** Classic Mastermind logic in a three-dimensional environment.
- **Interactive UI:** Drag-and-drop or click-based peg placement.
- **Visual Feedback:** Real-time clues for each guess to guide the player.
- **Customizable Difficulty:** Adjustable code length and color options.
- **Unity Project Structure:** Organized for easy extension and modification.
